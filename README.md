# Crypto-Experiment
Source code for Crypto Experiment in the spring term in 2019.
Including codes for various algorithms.
- math functions: Extend Euclid, CRT, Jacobi symbol, etc.
- encryption algorithms: DES, AES, RSA, ElGamal, SM2, etc. and ECC algorithms.
- Hash algorithms: SHA1, SHA3, and a simple birthday attack.
- Digital signature algorithm: SM2 signature.
- A secure file transport protocol, but it is not proved to be secure (only for homework).
I have not learnt courses about secure protocols, therefore the protocol might not be secure, but the algorithms are all proved to be right.
